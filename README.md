California Housing Predictions
Welcome to the California Housing Predictions repository! This project aims to predict housing prices in California using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts housing prices based on various features such as location, population, and median income. The dataset used for this project is the California housing dataset, which includes information from the 1990 U.S. Census.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, clean data, and visualize relationships between features.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models to predict housing prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model as a web application for users to input features and get price predictions.
